Emily Program Foundation group project

Capturing new volunteers (main priority):

Potential volunteer sends Emily an email to express interest
Emily responds with volunteer application
Return completed application or reply via 'actual' mail (not a big amount of applicants, likely more efficient with an online tool)
Emily reviews application and responds with approval (or not)
Emily provides an orientation date.
Application captures volunteers skills to be searched later. They might want the ability as admins to add skills or augment the application form.
Search among existing volunteers:

No search or skills tracking to search for skills. Blog writers, office managers - discussed skills. Video editing, public speaking, 'layouts'

search volunteers by skill
email this result set
email has a form for signing up for the event?
Emily has the ability to view if the RSVPs for the event
Tracking board members (potential second project, out of scope)

board members (also volunteers)
development action plan
where they are in their term
conflict of interest paperwork
Other Considerations

have gmail accounts, could benefit from google auth
The Application process will require them to sign a waiver of some sort. They need to confirm with lawyer if e-signature is OK
No need for volunteers to login. Only the staff and possibly approved volunteers.
They have brand style guides they will share with you.
Project Objectives

Primary:

Streamline volunteer capture process
Capture Confidentiality agreements (checkbox should suffice, they will check with their lawyer)
selectable 'skills' list for volunteers
search for volunteers by skills
add existing volunteers to db as well
Stretch:

admin manages 'skills' list for volunteers
Capture Interest and capabilities
Provide search for volunteers and their skills
distinguish between volunteers and board members (likely another project)
